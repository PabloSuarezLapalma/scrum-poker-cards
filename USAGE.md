2. Settings panel slides down
3. Change scale or access actions
4. Tap anywhere else to close

### Card Selection
- Swipe through cards horizontally
- Tap to select
- Selected card shows with yellow checkmark
- Appears large at the top

## üéØ Planning Table

### Understanding the Table
- **Circular Layout**: Participants arranged around virtual table
- **Face-Down Cards**: Shows "?" when voted but not revealed
- **Empty Slot**: Dashed border means user hasn't voted yet
- **Your Avatar**: Has white ring border
- **Colors**: Each user gets random color (Red/Blue/Yellow/Green)

### Real-Time Updates
- New users appear instantly when they join
- Cards flip instantly when selected
- Inactive users (10s) disappear automatically
- "Reveal Cards" button becomes active when all have voted

## ‚öôÔ∏è Settings & Actions

### Reveal Cards Button
- **Disabled** (gray): Not all users have voted yet
- **Enabled** (green): All users have voted - click to reveal
- **After Reveal**: Shows checkmark, can't reveal again

### New Round Button
- Clears all votes
- Resets all cards to unselected
- Hides revealed cards
- Keeps same participants and settings

### Leave Room Button
- Exits current room
- Returns to join/create screen
- Other users remain in the room

## üîß Troubleshooting

### User Not Appearing?
- Check they entered the correct room code
- Make sure they clicked "Join Room"
- Try refreshing both browsers

### Cards Not Syncing?
- Check localStorage is enabled
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check console for errors

### Room Code Not Working?
- Codes are case-sensitive (auto-uppercased)
- Codes are 6 characters exactly
- Room creator must be active

### Mobile Layout Issues?
- App requires JavaScript enabled
- Works best on modern browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, Firefox)
- Portrait orientation recommended

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### Facilitator Role
1. Create the room first
2. Share code before meeting starts
3. Change scale if needed before estimation
4. Wait for all votes before revealing
5. Use "New Round" between stories

### For Estimators
1. Join room as soon as you get the code
2. Keep your tab/window active
3. Vote honestly and independently
4. Don't discuss estimates until revealed
5. Re-vote if you change your mind (just click another card)

### Remote Teams
- Share screen to show the table
- Use ? card if you need to ask questions
- Use ‚òï card if you need a break
- Discuss outliers (highest/lowest) first

## üåü Advanced Features

### Multi-Tab Testing
1. Open app in 2 browser tabs
2. Join same room with different names
3. See real-time sync in action

### Custom Scale Examples
- **Hour Estimation**: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 40
- **Risk Level**: Low, Medium, High, Critical
- **Confidence**: 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%
- **Priority**: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, Won't Have

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- R: New Round
- Esc: Deselect card

## üìä Session Management
