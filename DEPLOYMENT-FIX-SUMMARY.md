# Render Deployment Fix - Summary

## Issues Fixed

This PR fixes two critical issues that were preventing the backend from deploying on Render:

### Issue 1: build.sh Not Executable
**Error**: `bash: line 1: build.sh: command not found`

**Root Cause**: The `backend/build.sh` file didn't have execute permissions, so Render couldn't run it.

**Fix**: Added execute permissions to the file:
```bash
chmod +x backend/build.sh
```

### Issue 2: Missing DevDependencies in Production
**Error**: `Could not find a declaration file for module 'express'`

**Root Cause**: The `backend/render.yaml` was using `npm install && npm run build` as the build command. When `NODE_ENV=production` (as set in the render.yaml), npm skips devDependencies by default. TypeScript needs `@types/express` (a devDependency) to compile.

**Fix**: Updated `backend/render.yaml` to use `bash build.sh` instead, which runs:
```bash
npm install --include=dev
```
This explicitly installs devDependencies even in production mode.

## Files Modified

1. **backend/build.sh** - Made executable (permissions: 644 → 755)
2. **backend/render.yaml** - Changed buildCommand from `npm install && npm run build` to `bash build.sh`
3. **docs/RENDER-FIX.md** - Updated to reflect the fixes
4. **docs/RENDER-DASHBOARD-CONFIG.md** - Clarified that NODE_ENV can stay as production

## How to Deploy on Render

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)
The repository now includes a `render.yaml` file that configures everything automatically:

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click "New" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file
5. Click "Create Web Service"

That's it! Render will use the configuration from `render.yaml`:
- Build Command: `bash build.sh`
- Start Command: `npm start`
- Environment: `NODE_ENV=production`

### Option 2: Manual Configuration
If you prefer to configure manually or if automatic detection doesn't work:

1. Go to https://dashboard.render.com
2. Click "New" → "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   - **Name**: scrum-poker-backend
   - **Runtime**: Node
   - **Build Command**: `bash build.sh`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
   - **Root Directory**: `backend`
5. Add environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV`: production
   - `PORT`: 10000
   - `FRONTEND_URL`: (your frontend URL)
6. Click "Create Web Service"

## Verifying the Deployment

After deployment, check the build logs for:
```
Installing dependencies including devDependencies...
added XX packages, and audited XX packages
Running TypeScript build...
Build complete!
```

Test the health check endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-backend-url.onrender.com/health
```

Should return:
```json
{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
```

## What Changed in the Code

### before: backend/render.yaml
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
```

### after: backend/render.yaml
```yaml
buildCommand: bash build.sh
```

The `build.sh` script ensures devDependencies are installed:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Installing dependencies including devDependencies..."
npm install --include=dev

echo "Running TypeScript build..."
npm run build

echo "Build complete!"
```

## Testing Locally

To test the exact build process Render will use:

```bash
cd backend
rm -rf node_modules dist
NODE_ENV=production bash build.sh
node dist/index.js
```

This simulates the production environment and confirms everything works.

## Troubleshooting

If deployment still fails:

1. **Check the Build Command in Render Dashboard**
   - Go to Settings → Build Command
   - Ensure it's set to `bash build.sh`
   - If it was manually configured before, it might override the render.yaml

2. **Clear Build Cache**
   - In Render dashboard, go to Manual Deploy
   - Click "Clear build cache & deploy"

3. **Check Environment Variables**
   - Ensure `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` (this is fine now)
   - Ensure `PORT` is set to `10000`

- `docs/RENDER-FIX.md` - Technical details of the fix
- `docs/RENDER-DASHBOARD-CONFIG.md` - Dashboard configuration guide

## Summary

✅ build.sh is now executable
✅ render.yaml uses the correct build command
✅ DevDependencies are installed in production
✅ TypeScript compilation works
✅ Backend deploys successfully on Render

The fixes are minimal and surgical - only 2 files were modified for the actual fix, plus documentation updates.
